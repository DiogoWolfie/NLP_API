He opts to help her as much as he possibly can, and through those efforts, she begins getting acquainted with his kindness. Will she reciprocate?

A delightfully charming romantic comedy about a boy who only has eyes for the girl who always forgets her glasses!

With the new school year comes a new homeroom, new classmates, and a new desk for the timid Komura. But any trepidation he might've felt quickly dissipates when he catches sight of Mie, his new seat neighbor.

Apt to quietly blurt out the most random things, the quirky Mie wears thick glasses that accentuate her lovely eyes, making Komura’s heart skip a beat!

Unfortunately, Mie is pathologically forgetful and can never seem to remember to bring her glasses to class. It's not all bad, though! Her resulting squinty, mean-girl face sends Komura’s heart into overdrive too!

While Komura is keen to help out and share his textbooks with Mie, will his heart give out from the almost daily strain of being up close and personal with his crush?!

His life consisted of misfortune after misfortune, culminating in an unlucky death during an incident on a school boat trip, trying to save a girl he barely knew. After death, he met a god of reincarnation who requested that the hundred or so dead passengers - one of them being the girl he tried in vain to save - be reincarnated into another world. Yet a series of unfortunate events forced Hiroto to reincarnate with even less luck than before, starting with nothing but a tremendous amount of Mana. His second life, far worse than his first, came to a cruel end. However, upon meeting the god a second time, he was informed that there would be yet another reincarnation - one that had already been set in motion and could not be stopped. Not wanting Hiroto to endure a third life filled with suffering, the god cursed him before he was reborn in the hopes that he would either die quickly or commit suicide. Hiroto was reborn once more as a half-vampire, half-dark elf. A dhampir. Not wanting a fourth life, he is determined to live this third life with the only things remaining from his previous lives - Death Magic and his enormous Mana pool.

However, everything changed on the day of the Black Sun. The Breakdown Phenomenon which ruined the town where he took Hijiri away and resides was caused by the Black Sun. As Hijiri begins evaporating, she hangs a grimoire to his neck, requesting it to protect Kasuga. On losing all of his other friends as well as family and Hijiri distressed, Kasuga asks for his planet to be great again, which contributes to the grimoire artificially re-building his regular life, and making him forget the destruction of the town and Hijiri's disappearance. Lilith Asami, a mage, is sent to investigate the ruins and she finds the powerful spell within their stead. She makes Kasuga recall the specific events and hence the enchantment is broken, not without the grimoire telling him that Hijiri is not dead. Kasuga decides that his only alternative will be to become a magus himself therefore Hijiri could be rescued by him and he therefore joins a secret school for mages that copes with magic dilemmas all over the world, the Royal Biblia Academy. There he is introduced together with the Trinity Seven, seven powerful female mages who are at the top of the respective disciplines (Lilith being one of them) who will aid him in his aim to become a strong wizard and discover the truth about Hijiri along with the Black Sun. He soon discovers that another of the Trinity Seven, Arin, looks almost exactly like his lost cousin although she shows a wholly different character.

In the world of ""Dungeon and Stone,"" only one city remained standing following the world's destruction. Every month, a labyrinth would appear, offering explorers a chance to clear it and earn rewards. Barbarians were viewed as useless in all but combat, and those who didn't fight were unable to survive. If someone couldn't pay the exorbitant taxes imposed by the city, they faced the death penalty for tax evasion.
If it's discovered that a player possesses the character they're playing, they're labelled an ""evil spirit"" and killed. The only way for Lee Hansoo to survive is to venture into the labyrinth and risk his life in battle.

As far as everyone's concerned, Conan is just a little kid anyway, even to Ran. This is extremely frustrating to Conan since nobody will listen to a 'little boy.' Despite this, Conan has a mission, to find the criminals who did this to him and get the antidote to that drug.

Named Yuri, he is doted on by his parents and lives a new life in peace – as it should be. However, the country where Yuri and the others live is threatened by the “other humans” who dominate the vast expanse of the continent and is in danger of dying. Yuri and his family can’t stay out of it and are caught in the middle of the war… The Knights' House, the sword of the kingdom that wields a lance and kakedori birds. The death of his uncle, who was the leader of the Hovu family, brings Yuri’s father back to the world of knights, who had left the house to hate killing each other. Yuri is forced to attend the Knights’ Academy, where knights are trained, and the encounter there will drastically change the fate of Yuri and the kingdom.

This all changes the moment his life in Japan comes to an abrupt end and he finds himself reborn in the strange new world of the Shiyalta Kingdom. His new life includes everything he once lacked: loving parents, a comfortable home, and a promising future breeding and raising birds on his dad’s ranch. For centuries, the kingdom he now calls home has enjoyed peace and prosperity, shielded by friendly nations that, like Shiyalta itself, were established with the collapse of a once-great empire. War is a distant problem, relevant only to Shiyalta’s ruling families whose warriors periodically set out to join the fighting upon massive birds trained by Yuri’s dad and others. But this peaceful existence can’t last forever. Something rotten lies at the heart of the kingdom, and it doesn’t take someone with Yuri’s exceptional intelligence to realize that those distant battles will only remain irrelevant for so long.

Handsome, good-natured, righteous, strong, and… Anyway, there was one big flaw in the male lead’s damn fine teacher. It was his foolish only daughter who was filled with greed. A tenacious villainess extra, who always comes back to haunt the male lead in every way, but cannot be abandoned because she is his teacher’s daughter. Throughout reading the novel, I cursed at that daughter. Saying that if it was me, I wouldn’t live like that. ‘But that didn’t mean that I wanted to be her!’ What was worse, Father has already died, and my reputation is the worst. Inevitably, I ran away, but… I died. However, when I opened my eyes, Father was alive!? ‘If so, in this life, I will definitely save Father!’ However… “To think they’re aiming at my granddaughter!? I’ll kill them all!” Why do I see Grandfather, who doesn’t even appear many times throughout the novel, so often like this? “Marriage? No. Yeonie said that she would live by my side for the rest of her life.” Even Father, somehow became weird. Moreover, “Why do you keep avoiding me? Is this also my mistake?” Isn’t the main character suddenly becoming obsessed with me? “Originally, I was destined to die. Until you came here.” I saved the time-limited bastard, but isn’t it that no good deed goes unpunished? “At least when I’m in front of you… I don’t think I’m tr*sh.” The villain who blew off my neck is suddenly trying to repent. Is it really okay if it’s like this?

I was once like that…”
This is a world where dangerous monsters roam the land and adventurers make their living by defeating them. With level as the symbol of absolute power, those with the higher levels gained wealth and fame while those with the lower levels exploited others further beneath them.
The protagonist, Alca, was called a “corpse scrapper” because of his “Unable to gain experience” skill, which prevented his level from rising, making him the lowest in society. Under such circumstances, he obtained the “Abyss Armor,” a suit of armor of calamity.
This armor makes him able to use “Level Drain,” which allows him to absorb the level of the person he kills!
“With this power, all those who stand in my way will be……”
Alca, who now has obtained the “Level Drain”, begins to increase his fame and abilities as an adventurer by absorbing the levels of both humans and monsters alike.
But before his path, dragons, the strongest species in the world, as well as adventurers of the natural disaster class, of which there are only a few in the world known. stand in his way.
However, even they are nothing but stepping stones for him.
This is a heroic tale of a jet-black knight, once despised as the lowest of lowest, who now takes from those above and grows to become the most powerful being in the world
